pages="93",
abstract="N -subjettiness is a jet shape designed to identify boosted hadronic objects such as top quarks. Given N subjet axes within a jet, N-subjettiness sums the angular distances of jet constituents to their nearest subjet axis. Here, we generalize and improve on N -subjettiness by minimizing over all possible subjet directions, using a new variant of the k-means clustering algorithm. On boosted top benchmark samples from the BOOST2010 workshop, we demonstrate that a simple cut on the 3-subjettiness to 2-subjettiness ratio yields 20{\%} (50{\%}) tagging efficiency for a 0.23{\%} (4.1{\%}) fake rate, making N -subjettiness a highly effective boosted top tagger. N-subjettiness can be modified by adjusting an angular weighting exponent, and we find that the jet broadening measure is preferred for boosted top searches. We also explore multivariate techniques, and show that additional improvements are possible using a modified Fisher discriminant. Finally, we briefly mention how our minimization procedure can be extended to the entire event, allowing the event shape N-jettiness to act as a fixed N cone jet algorithm.",

title="Energy correlation functions for jet substructure",
journal="Journal of High Energy Physics",
year="2013",
volume="2013",
number="6",
pages="108",
abstract="We show how generalized energy correlation functions can be used as a powerful probe of jet substructure. These correlation functions are based on the energies and pair-wise angles of particles within a jet, with (N{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}1)-point correlators sensitive to N-prong substructure. Unlike many previous jet substructure methods, these correlation functions do not require the explicit identification of subjet regions. In addition, the correlation functions are better probes of certain soft and collinear features that are masked by other methods. We present three Monte Carlo case studies to illustrate the utility of these observables: 2-point correlators for quark/gluon discrimination, 3-point correlators for boosted W /Z/Higgs boson identification, and 4-point correlators for boosted top quark identification. For quark/gluon discrimination, the 2-point correlator is particularly powerful, as can be understood via a next-to-leading logarithmic calculation. For boosted 2-prong resonances the benefit depends on the mass of the resonance.",
